								<p>Dissland is an amusement park in the north of Gigapolis San Diego &amp; Tijuana, capital of Citivas CASTITAS, taking up more than one hundred square miles and enjoying semi-autonomy from G.U.N.. This amusement park subsumed other major theme parks in California from before the FATE War. It was later reformed into an art district, with nearby residential areas and arms facilities.</p><p>Out of reach from G.U.N., Dissland is an exclave occupied by hippie artists and street racers. It was established as an independent community by a group of anarchist G.A.M.E.R.s who oppose the system, and the current residents continue their legacy.</p><p>Defended by an armed guard unit known as Dissland’s Armed Guards, or D.A.G., most patrols operate dressed as former park mascots or anime characters. The units clusters around the commander, who dresses up like a giant rat, to march around the amusement park twice a day.</p><p>During this parade, it is routine for D.A.G. to assert their sovereignty. When the situation calls for it, they also demonstrate this power by warning away enemies with weapons cleverly hidden inside their costumes. Their cars are not just for looks but come armed and ready for combat. On paper the parades are a holdover from the past for nostalgia purposes, but in reality they are actually a defense patrol securing the controlled area.</p><p><strong>The castles:</strong> This is the administration area for Dissland, with constructions built like ancient castles from the Middle Ages. The castles act the offices for the mafia boss ruling the area, as well as luxurious guest houses designed to host important visitors. Some parts of this area are also used as residential blocks for high level park management.</p><p><strong>The amusement park:</strong> An enormous theme park, about the size of the largest parks from the 20th century. The park itself is perpetually full of noise and life due to the cheap accommodations located within park boundaries. The security situation, on the other hand, is not as good as one would expect.</p><p><strong>Lovers’ Ferris Wheel:</strong> A newly-designed massive construction, built like an old-time Ferris wheel. As the flagship landmark of the park, Lovers’ Ferris Wheel rotates around Dissland every three hours. Each cabin is equipped with top-tier amenities. Besides the three-hour ride, visitors can also book a room for the whole day at a discounted price to see incredible nighttime views of the park.</p>						</div>

								<p>Goemon City is underground, roughly located near the ruins of Hakone, a mountainous town in Kanagawa, Japan. During G.A.M.E.R.s’ War, the Japanese government and organized crime syndicates reached an agreement in secret to hollow out a massive cavity deep in the mountain. The dome of the city is reinforced with numerous stainless-steel towers, and this location serves as a fallback for emergency evacuations in case of any major disaster in Tokyo.</p><p>Named after the legendary vigilante Ishikawa Goemon, this city is an enlarged recreation of the Kabukichō district in Tokyo. On the very bottom, skyscrapers for Gokudō headquarters gleam proudly among vanity and corruption. One by one, these buildings are erected in a neat-and-tidy order.</p><p>As the local Gokudō organizations are extremely powerful, every tower is stationed by a specific branch of the organization. The whole underground megalopolis is the battleground for dozens of Gokudō power struggles. More than the imposing appearance, these towers belong to various gangs and support the infinite dome with uncounted iron and steel.</p><p>Inside every mega building in Goemon City, the layout is systematically designed as a self-sufficient settlement for mixed use, supporting both residential and commercial purposes. Like traditional mixed-use locations, the bottom stories are reserved for the advertising and commerce of retail businesses. On the top of each tower is the organizational emblem, echoing the proud family ties fostered during the warring states period. Ruled by these different Gokudō powers, everyone is strictly protected and controlled by the “Goemon City Entertainment Association&#8221;, the highest autonomous organization, as long as they obey the orders both written and unwritten in the city.</p><p>The city view is the visual embodiment of the unwritten rules for Goemon City, on which the magic city flourishes &#8212; the Gokudō houses serve their own leader. On one hand, they bloom and blossom based on resources inspired by East Las Vegas; on the other, they maintain a delicate balance among all powers and reinforce the artificial dome that is closely connected to the survival of the city. Even the Japanese mafia follow their own code and morality.</p><p>Travellers here quickly learn the unspoken rule; Goemon City is a clandestine city that no outsiders are allowed to take a picture of.<br />In this megalopolis below the surface, many outlaws wanted in the outside world are sheltered by the Gokudō organizations. The entertainment visitors experience here is not exactly the suitable to share with the world above.</p><p>Authorized by Z.E.U.S., and G.U.N., extraterritoriality has been granted to Goemon City. Located on the edge of the Gigapolis of the Great Sun, in Citivas INDUSTRIA, this city has developed into a metropolis that takes sensual and sexual pleasure to the extreme.</p><p>During the FATE War, the Grand Prix de MOTO ROYALE, the most popular CySports, was cancelled. After the war, the Ebisu Circuit, with a brand-new design, was built in Goemon City for the race. Once a year during the Shikigami Festival, huge floats inspired by Japanese folklore are created by each Gokudō house and installed on the circuit. The race is a fresh new experience with extreme excitement &#8212; On the Ebisu Circuit in Goemon City, every race is unique.</p><p>Throughout the grand race, the whole city will enter a temporary lockdown. Once the opening whistle sounds, everyone must watch out for their own safety and protection. It’s every man for himself.</p><p>All property in Goemon City belongs to individual Gokudō houses. Any damage or death taking place in the race is accounted for as an operating expense and underwritten by the houses’ insurance policies. On the other hand, if the participants cause damage so great that it could lead to an operational crisis or endanger the public, the organizer of the grand race, the International Federation of CySports, or I.F.C., has authorized the Goemon City Entertainment Association to take all necessary means to take care of the aftermath.</p><p>From time to time, outsiders can see private troops of one Gokudō house dashing from one skyscraper to another. In the aftermath of fire, explosions, and screaming, the emblem on top of the tower may change. For the most part, however, the internal machinations never put tourists in danger &#8212; unless these outsiders attempt to intervene in the delicate balance of power in Goemon City&#8230;</p>						</div>

								<p>Located in the EUROPOLIS, in Citivas GRATIA, Calais-Dover Undersea Belt connects the ruins of England and France by sea. It is a conglomerate of underwater cities built on the Channel Tunnel.</p><p>The distance between Calais and Dover was the shortest route between England and France. In war, this is the fastest route to take for any European state to initiate an attack on the United Kingdom. In human history, several wars have broken out to secure this area. In the peace after World War II, both countries agreed on constructing an undersea tunnel on the path in the name of goodwill and international trade.</p><p>Since the Channel Tunnel was constructed dozens of meters below sea level, even advanced satellites could not detect activity down there. The Calais-Dover Undersea Belt was developed by G.U.N. as a vital military station for human allies during the FATE War. Subsequent to the war, dome settlements were built on top of the tunnel, from Dover in old England to Calais in what remains of France, forming a glamorous belt under the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>This is the story of Calais-Dover Undersea Belt. Transparent domes cluster together, forming underwater settlements. The Calais-Dover Undersea Belt is like a necklace of precious pearls worn by the goddess Europa, the jewel of the continent. After the FATE War, the European continent was burnt and wasted, making the belt as dazzling as a diamond.</p><p>There are eleven relay stations standing along the belt above the water line. Drawing from the same origin as Europa, these stations are named after the ancient Greek gods &#8212; Hera as the Queen of the gods, Demeter as the goddess of Agriculture, Poseidon as the god of sea, Athena as the goddess of wisdom, Apollo as the god of the sun, Artemis as the goddess of the hunt, Aphrodite as the goddess of Love, Ares as the god of war, Hephaestus as the god of fire, Hermes as the messenger of the gods, and Hestia as the goddess of the Hearth. Zeus as the father of gods is excluded here, as Z.E.U.S. stands for the only ruler above all these.</p><p>In these eleven towers named after the Greek gods, distinguished culture from pre-war European countries can be discovered here: You can take an art trip of Italian renaissance in the tower of Demeter or hear the Celtic flute unique to Ireland in the tower of Artemis. Once one steps in the underwater shuttle that runs on the Calais-Dover Undersea Belt, a visitor can expect a wonderful trip around Europe as it was before the war.<br />Taking a tour by underwater shuttle is pleasant, but piloting a private submarine is even better. In a self-guided tour under the sea, one can bring a biologist for an exploration of marine ecology. Both transportation means are popular with tourists travelling here.</p><p><strong>Administration Tower:</strong> This region is essentially an independent town, consisting of residential areas and commercial areas. Along the Undersea Belt, an administration tower is set up every 15 kilometers, serving as the core for the surrounding city and extending upwards above the sea. There are eleven administration towers in total, and they are named after Greek gods, excluding Zeus.<br /><strong>Transportation area:</strong> Alongside the old Channel Tunnel are built numerous pipelines, through which high-speed shuttles run. The high-speed shuttles travel between Swanscombe and Lutetia, two cities which represent the remnants of England and France from before the war.<br /><strong>Underwater Dome Settlements:</strong> As the main residential area underwater, every settlement is a basic community for about 500 living units. In larger domes, there are public facilities such as schools, libraries, government offices, and business streets. The complicated pipelines connecting all domes form an intricate network. Some pipelines are used for shuttle services, some for business, tourism, or other purposes.</p>						</div>

								<p>Located in a massive sinkhole in the suburb of Gigapolis Equator, the capital of Citivas MODERATIO, Dragonfall used to be a floating fortress with an auxiliary ground base belonging to FATE’s military during the FATE War.</p><p>After the war, the floating fortress was wrecked and demolished. Local residents and scavengers started to construct numerous buildings that were neither legal nor safe along the base, surviving by siphoning the core energy from the base and salvaging the cutting-edge black technology remaining in the fortress. With a total population of ten million people, Dragonfall is one of the few settlements whose main industries directly build on the ruins left from the FATE era. From bottom to top, Dragonfall is arranged vertically with several distinct areas.<br /><br /><strong>The Base of the Primal Fortress:</strong> During the war, the bottom of the Dragonfall was used to recharge and resupply the base. In current times, the still functioning fusion reactors remain the main energy supplier for the whole of Dragonfall. This functionally limitless energy source paved the groundwork for all other economic development in the city.</p><p><strong>Spiral Mural Settlements:</strong> Many inhabitants built their homes, layer by layer, after digging into the wall of the base and connecting the wires with the energy facilities within. From the outer layer, they have dug around 150 meters inward. This slow progress makes the neighborhood diverse, with people of different social status mingling here. Like termites slowly working their way through the heartwood of a fallen tree, the ruins of the base serve as a hive of activity for the current residents. As the sun never shines in these settlements, this place is locally known as the &#8220;Snake Den.”<br /><br /><strong>Upper Mural Area:</strong> Surrounding the edge of the massive sinkhole, residential areas and conglomerates have established themselves to form a giant torus, completely circling the former base. The residents here are mostly management sent by international companies to supervise the various Dragonfall extraction and salvage businesses. Some intrepid individuals who were attracted by the same opportunities created with black technology have also arrived, both from the law-abiding and lawless worlds. In general, the living standard here is much higher than in the Spiral Mural Settlements. In this district, social order is maintained by armed patrol troops. People call this area the Ring of the Lords, as this is only accessible to the rich.<br /><br /><strong>Floating Fortress Ruins (the Mine):</strong> Since the moment the FATE War ceased, the ruins of the fortress have become a bizarre sight, which neither fall nor move. As precious black technology can easily be found in the wreck of the FATE military base, this place has become a hot mining spot by various powers after the war. The mine, however, holds a great deal of unknown danger. Accidents happen here frequently because of irregular gravity generation caused by broken emitters. Because of this, the salvage industry here was quickly controlled by gangs and human traffickers, who provide service for countless military and private security contractors that are drawn by high profits and undeterred by the risky working conditions. Between the fortress ruins and the ground settlements, several flakes broken off from the main fort still float in the air. Caused by malfunctioning anti-gravity emitters, this unique sight has become the greatest tourist attraction in Dragonfall.<br /><br /><strong>Dragon’s Crown Circuit:</strong> From the deserted fortress ruins high above the ground to the central sinkhole of Dragonfall, this space is one of the eight Global Level MOTO ROYALE racetracks. After a quick traditional circuit of the floating fortress, the course runs in a spiral to Dragonfall’s base. Once the mines there have been traversed, racers travel back up to the starting line at the Dragon’s Crown, completing the double-helix. Several consecutive speed records for the Dragon’s Crown circuit have been broken during the downhill section of the course. Whenever a race is held, hordes of tourists pour in, considerably stimulating the Dragonfall economy.</p>						</div>

								<p>The core of the east area of Gigapolis Anansi, the capital of Citivas LIBERALITAS, the feminam area is built based on the totem of a spider belly. Meanwhile, this place also ranks as the first world metropolis built from the ground up as an art installation. Transformed from Lagos, the capital of Nigeria of the old time, the feminam area corresponds to the masculum area formed from Accra, the capital of Ghana. This massive 480km wide city is the crown jewel of West Africa.</p>
<p>Nicknamed the City of the Spider, Gigapolis Anansi is located in West Africa. During its initial formation, this city was designed and built by Ghana, Togo, Bénin, and Nigeria. It was based on the core concept of the spider and the belief of Anansi, the god of West Africa.</p>
<p>Since the very day Anansi was completed, this city received great honor. It was designated by UNESCO to be a world cultural heritage site due to the city’s utterly unique layout and architecture. At that time, Anansi was also assessed to be the leading metropolis for modern art by the world’s leading academics.</p>
<p>While the metropolis was still under development, construction was once stopped due to a lack of available capital. Work was not able to resume until Gigacorp AKSUM financed the project with the vast majority of the remaining funds, under one condition. In the downtown, an area must be reserved for Gigacorp AKSUM to be their brand-new headquarters, in the form of the Queen of Sheba, the icon of the gigacorp.</p>
<p>Most people visiting Anansi start their tour with the central business area. This is where most public art and amphitheaters are located. From dawn to dusk, songs and dancing from across the vast African musical tradition are performed. The shows never stop in every business area in the feminam area &#8212; This is the place to go if you’d like to witness the debut of a future superstar, with all kinds of amazing music echoing in the wild.</p>
<p>When travelers leave the central business area to explore further into the general administration area, they have a better understanding of the essence of the community culture, which converges from every African country. Locals even refer to Gigapolis Anansi as a miniature Africa.</p>
<p><strong>City Planning:</strong> The feminam area is inspired by the local mythology of West Africa and the Nazca totems in South America. The city designer took the bold choice of adopting the original idea of the Nazca lines as part of the city planning, while keeping the cultural feeling of the city distinctly African.</p>
<p>The main city of Gigapolis Anansi is shaped as twin spiders, each looking identical with three main city areas corresponding to the head, chest and belly. The eight main lines extending outwards are reminiscent of four pairs of spider legs. When viewed from space, its shape is obvious.</p>
<p>The feminam area is laid out thusly:</p>
<p><strong>The Spider Belly:</strong> This is a giant power plant reacting with nuclear fusion, which provides the inhabitants clean and ample energy. In the meantime, the Spider Belly is also the core for local economics and business.</p>
<p><strong>High-End Residential Area:</strong> A group of modern buildings constructed with high technology after the war. Residents who live or pass by here have a higher Citizen Development Index. The interior design is a collage of various structure styles of the old time, known for its aesthetics and diversity.</p>
<p><strong>Face of Sheba:</strong> Under the control of Gigacorp AKSUM, Gigapolis Anansi houses the company’s headquarters. Therefore, in the center of the Spider Belly, a massive mask colossus is built in the form of the Queen of Sheba, which can only be seen clearly when looked down on from above.</p>
<p><strong>Residential areas:</strong> Every residential area has its own unique culture and features. The social order varies from district to district. In these areas, we can see buildings with vibrant colors and a short-distance transportation system elevated high in the air.</p>
<p><strong>Administration Towers:</strong> Every residential district owns one that is accompanied with powerful images from local African cultures.</p>
<p><strong>Main Lines Leading Outwards:</strong> The eight main lines, or legs, lead outwards and are connected to the Administration Area. These legs serve as the main mass transit system for the city, leading directly to the core downtown areas. If one looks down at the main lines with the Spider Belly, the feminam resembles the Nazca Lines composition of a spider.</p>						</div>

								<p>Rumor has it that during the G.A.M.E.R.S War, there was a luxurious cruise ship in the Pacific Ocean. On the ship, Bernard Lamp was the official in charge of judicial affairs, and he successfully defended the vessel from pirates with his G.A.M.E.R. talents when facing attacks on the sea. As the war continued to escalate and the opportunity to find a safe port became more and more rare, he was able to successfully negotiate a new partnership with the marauding fleets of pirates. Ever since then, Lamp has set up a small armed merchant armada, creating rights of free passage and weapons trading agreements between the pirates and local nations around the Pacific.</p><p>Subsequent to the profitable trading arrangements with the pirates, Lamp built up a close business relationship with Gigacorp EKEKCONN and Gigacorp URANUS, forming an independent power known as the KAPITEIN Armed Merchant Armada (K.A.M.A.) and thus began maintaining peace and safety in the Pacific Ocean without formal authorization.</p><p>As the Armada continued to grow in size and influence, Lamp began to forge alliances with existing small-medium powers on the sea, such as the Vanguard of Currents, led by Lin Yung-Yu, in the Indo-Pacific. Since Lamp had no heir, he took Lin Yung-Yu in as his godchild because of her brains and bravery. Hand in hand, Lamp taught Lin anything and everything about K.A.M.A. and promoted her to be a staff captain.</p><p>At the beginning of the FATE War, K.A.M.A. lost most of their armed ships and gunpowder in the first wave of attack by the M.A.L. LUXURIA. In ruins and remains, Lin assumes leadership and starts to rebuild K.A.M.A., by taking over the destroyed ships on the sea. Over a period of years, under her steady command, the group was able to reconstruct itself to its former glory.</p><p>By chance, this independent armada, cruising among oceans, has become the only paradise on earth during the FATE War. Within one year, K.A.M.A. has become as strong as a superpower. In the end, Lin has led K.A.M.A. to grow into one of the few external powers, completely unattached to G.U.N.’s rule and dominating the ocean. His unique G.A.M.E.R. powers allowed the fleet to rapidly rearm and rebuild even with the world torn asunder by conflict.</p><p>After the war, K.A.M.A. turned into a self-reliant political entity, free from the G.U.N., in possession of several convoys. Built from some of the largest ships ever constructed, when viewed from the horizon the outline of the Armada resembles a vast mountain range. The main fleet serves as the administration center, constructed with an abundance of official buildings modeled after famous vessels from the Age of Discovery. This unique scene makes it one of the must-see attractions of K.A.M.A.</p><p>In K.A.M.A., we can see migratory fish that were once considered extinct, such as yellowfin tuna, in the fishery area. The armada has numerous submarines in its possession, so people can sometimes enjoy diving among coral reefs as the fleet transits the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>When it comes to must-eat delicacies in K.A.M.A., seafood from the fishery area are at the top of the list. The seafood harvested here grows in seawater where plastic particles have been filtered out. It is perfectly safe to eat any seafood that comes from K.A.M.A. Clean seafood is a rare luxury in the world, but abundant in the armada.</p><p>Moving around with the currents in the Pacific Ocean, K.A.M.A. is a floating land without a fixed location. Isolated from G.U.N.’s rule, K.A.M.A. has its own laws. Their ships come from every corner of the world, including modern European ships and ancient Chinese junk ships.</p><p>Enjoying a self-sufficient existence, K.A.M.A. is equipped with boats and ships, big and small, specialized for all kinds of functions. The central area commands the whole fleet and provides energy, the foreign trade area deals with tourism and customs, as well as fishery, aquaculture, and agriculture areas. Since at its core this fleet is an armada, there are also zones for defense facilities and armed military ships.</p><p>On K.A.M.A., it is mandatory for all able-bodied citizens to serve in the military. To remain more flexible in case of an attack, there are no designated residential or weapons storage spaces. Rather, arms and turrets are spread out between the whole armada to minimize risk. As for the fleet, K.A.M.A. has a series of warships designed for air and naval strikes. When the situation calls for it, these warships can be detached from the armada for independent military operation.</p><p><strong>Ships That Make up KAMA:</strong> The flagship and the main power ship are in the center, and they are situated in the highest point of K.A.M.A. Other ships are positioned based on their size and number. In general, the smaller a ship is, the more of them there are and the farther they are away from the center. A detachable energy transfer pipeline system is installed between the main power ship and the rest of the fleet, as well as a robust network of flexible bridges for ease of travel. The following is a brief introduction of the important sections of K.A.M.A.</p><p><strong>The Flagship: </strong>The highest capital ship in K.A.M.A., this was once BernardLamp’s original vessel, now serving as an upper-class residential area. From the outside, it looks like a city in the mountains, with the fleet command on the top. K.A.M.A. has the only water-cooled massive nuclear fusion engine in the world, which is able to provide plentiful energy for both the civilian and military sections of the fleet.Apart from residence for the Admiral and command staff, the flagship also boasts mansions for the leader of every convoy, guest houses for envoys from G.U.N. or other political entities, as well as world class recreation areas.</p><p><strong>The residential areas:</strong> Retrofitted from what once were premium cruise ships, these residential units are scattered throughout the flotilla. Each ship can house thousands of residents comfortably.</p><p><strong>The agriculture area:</strong> An enormous area assembled with cargo ships, on which crops are cultivated along with a limited number of livestock. On the bottom where the ballast water was originally retained, fresh water is now stored.</p><p><strong>The fishery and aquaculture area:</strong> Situated on the exterior fringe of K.A.M.A., the fishery and aquaculture area is equipped with extensive floating enclosures to raise fish and mollusks. There are also Seine fishing boats, like those used before the FATE War, which can detach from the armada for independent fishing operations.</p><p><strong>The industrial zone:</strong> While limited in the Armada, over the course of its travels multiple priceless FATE War relics have been recovered. This area of the flotilla is responsible for initial salvage, reverse engineering and maintenance of all FATE related technology.</p><p><strong>The foreign trade area:</strong> This area is populated by numerous vessels that used to be freight cargo container ships. Retrofitted into massive warehouses, these ships serve as the primary point of entry between foreign ships for trade with people from all over the world and the Armada. While clearing customs in the Armada is notoriously difficult, merchants around the world know that the fleet is one of the most lucrative trading outposts available and are always willing to wait.</p><p><strong>Empty mooring berth:</strong> Guests or ships with permits to enter can moor in this area, in accordance with the guidance from the harbormaster.</p><p><strong>Turrets/defense facilities:</strong> As one of the most important pieces of equipment in the organization, such facilities are spread out among the whole armada and are usually made up with railguns, all kinds of missiles and anti-aircraft artillery.</p><p><strong>Armed ships:</strong> Located on the exterior of the armada, these fleets consist of vessels for air-and-naval operations. When needed, the armed ships can detach from K.A.M.A. to carry out independent military operations.</p>						</div>

								<p>During the FATE War, FATE unlocked many futuristic technologies and granted permission to his armies to use these devastating weapons, in order to invade and seize the whole world with his Mechanical Angel Legion (M.A.L.).<br /><br />At the final moment, FATE realized the girl named SE7EN, who pierced him with her blade, was his daughter. In that instant before his death, his mechanical armies disbanded and his hatred dissolved. Unlocking authorities for numerous futuristic military equipment and facilities, FATE sent this extremely confidential information to SE7EN as his last gift. “LAPUNTU: El castillo en el cielo” was the greatest gift he could give her.<br /><br />Once an impressive flying station operated by Mechanical Angel Legion GREED, LAPUNTU mainly consists of a vertical floating cone, its main body, and three massive leaves serving as combat platforms.<br /><br />The three platforms were originally designed to carry aircraft and deploy soldiers for combat, so this station essentially served as a massive mobile aircraft carrier during the war.<br /><br />The main floating cone in the core is capable of creating a supreme G-field, absorbing all wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation and deflecting all known spectra possible, which isolates LAPUNTU from any detection. This active camouflage allows the fairly slow moving station to cross the world undetected by enemies. Assuming the reactor core doesn’t encounter any technical difficulties, the G-field has nearly unlimited sustainability.<br /><br />After SE7EN learned of the existence of LAPUNTU and its current location in the North Pole, the secret society transformed this place into a shelter for G.A.M.E.R.s all over the world thanks to its unbeatable active camouflage. Inside the cone, together with the three platforms, SE7EN began an extensive renovation of the station. LAPUNTU was turned into a mobile base with functional space for living and training, safe from interference by G.U.N. The G.A.M.E.R.s came up with a nickname for LAPUNTU: the Ark.<br /><br />LAPUNTU, however, is not the only existing fortress with black technology. Above Dragonfall, near Gigapolis Equator in Citivas MODERATIO, there is an abandoned floating city in ruins, causing distortion to surrounding gravity fields.</p>						</div>

								<p>Long before the Astro Ladder System was completed, six space stations under the control of different countries existed in geosynchronous orbit with Earth. When the Astro Ladder System and the Upper Equatorial Flange were initiating operation, talented individuals and materials were transported from Earth through the six major ground stations to the final geosynchronous stations. Critical resources were also sent to the core areas in the new space colonies under development.<br />At the beginning of the FATE War, all Astro Ladder Systems were abandoned when FATE appropriated the stations as command centers for each of his six legions. After the war, G.U.N. regained control of the six stations, which were restored and updated as the Geosynchronous Orbital Vanguards (G.O.V.) to help the organization rule the world.</p><p><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p><table data-tablestyle="MsoNormalTable" data-tablelook="1024" aria-rowcount="7"><tbody><tr aria-rowindex="1"><td data-celllook="69905"><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Space Station</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p></td><td data-celllook="69905"><p><b><span data-contrast="none">Astro Ladder</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p></td><td data-celllook="69905"><p><b><span data-contrast="none">Anchor Station</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p></td></tr><tr aria-rowindex="2"><td data-celllook="4369"><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Space Station</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">ENTERPRISE</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p></td><td data-celllook="4369"><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Transporter</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">B.M.U.S.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p></td><td data-celllook="4369"><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Transporter Station KIRK</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p></td></tr><tr aria-rowindex="3"><td data-celllook="4369"><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Space Station</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">GAGARIN</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p></td><td data-celllook="4369"><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Astro Ladder</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">VOSTOK 1</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p></td><td data-celllook="4369"><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Station</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">TERESHKOV</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p></td></tr><tr aria-rowindex="4"><td data-celllook="4369"><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Space Station</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MAASTRICHT</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p></td><td data-celllook="4369"><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Astro Ladder</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">ILIAD</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p></td><td data-celllook="4369"><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Station</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">ULYSSES</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p></td></tr><tr aria-rowindex="5"><td data-celllook="4369"><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Space Station</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">NAN</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">TIAN</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">MEN</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p></td><td data-celllook="4369"><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Astro Ladder</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">DING HAI</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p></td><td data-celllook="4369"><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Station</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">SHUI JING GONG</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p></td></tr><tr aria-rowindex="6"><td data-celllook="4369"><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Space Station</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">TAKAMAGAHARA</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p></td><td data-celllook="4369"><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Astro Ladder</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">KUSANAGI</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p></td><td data-celllook="4369"><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Station</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">SUSANOO</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p></td></tr><tr aria-rowindex="7"><td data-celllook="4369"><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Space Station</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">RAMA</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p></td><td data-celllook="4369"><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">RAMA&#8217;s Bridge</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p></td><td data-celllook="4369"><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Stargate</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p><p><b><span data-contrast="auto">HANUMAN</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{"> </span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Space Station ENTERPRISE:</strong> For the most part, Space Station ENTERPRISE was developed and constructed by the United States government. The name itself harkens back to a fictional spaceship from American pop culture. In its original incarnation, the station was specifically designed to research and operate in low-Earth orbit. Subsequently, it was renovated with more powerful thrusters, so the current orbit was adjusted to a much higher altitude. The station was also significantly expanded due to the relocation to this higher and more stable location.</p><p>The first Astro Ladder in the system to utilize a high-speed elevator, ENTERPRISE exchanges resources and personnel with Transporter Station KIRK on Earth via the highly efficient Transporter B.M.U.S.</p><p>ENTERPRISE is also known as “Federation City.” The American scientists who are stationed here like to greet each other with their right hand, with their index finger touching the middle finger, and the ring finger next to their pinkie. The gesture that almost looks like a hand trident, what started off as a joke among the station staff has over time become one of the most distinguishable features of ENTERPRISE.</p><p>During the FATE War, ENTERPRISE was the command center for Mechanical Angel Legion Luxuria, (M.A.L. LUXURIA).</p><p>After the war, G.U.N. took possession of ENTERPRISE officially. In reality, it is Gigacorp URANUS, the lead syndicate that built the station that has full control of ENTERPRISE.</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2098 size-full" src="../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SKETCH_ENTERPRISE_-01.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1200" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SKETCH_ENTERPRISE_-01.jpg 2000w, ../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SKETCH_ENTERPRISE_-01-300x180.jpg 300w, ../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SKETCH_ENTERPRISE_-01-1024x614.jpg 1024w, ../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SKETCH_ENTERPRISE_-01-768x461.jpg 768w, ../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SKETCH_ENTERPRISE_-01-1536x922.jpg 1536w, ../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SKETCH_ENTERPRISE_-01-600x360.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p><p><strong>Space Station GAGARIN:</strong> Space Station GAGARIN was mainly developed under the guidance of the Russian Federation, and was named after the very first astronaut from the original space race between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., Yuri Alekseyevich Gagarin (Юрий Алексеевич Гагарин). GAGARIN was invested and set up by both Gigacorp ZDRAVLJICA and Gigacorp EKEKCONN, with an ownership stake of 2:1.</p><p>Unlike other space stations, GAGARIN was from the very beginning set up to serve as a military base and as the first permanent residential space station. The first space day care center was constructed here. GAGARIN was also one of the first space stations equipped with a zero-gravity hydroponics system. The specialty here is the Sputnik-1 Vodka, a spirit brewed from zero-gravity potatoes.</p><p>GAGARIN is the second space station in the Astro Ladder System network. The ground base THRESHKOV features an Astro Ladder VOSTOK 1 with distinctly Soviet design, reminiscent of the time of Yuri Alekseyevich Gagarin.</p><p>During the FATE War, Space Station GAGARIN was used as a command center by the Mechanical Angel Legion Sloth, (M.A.L. SLOTH).</p><p>After the war, G.U.N. has taken official control of GAGARIN, and utilizes it as one of the two space stations to host meetings of the Security Council.</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2025 size-full" src="../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gov_background_916.jpg" alt="" width="2162" height="1080" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gov_background_916.jpg 2162w, ../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gov_background_916-300x150.jpg 300w, ../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gov_background_916-1024x512.jpg 1024w, ../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gov_background_916-768x384.jpg 768w, ../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gov_background_916-1536x767.jpg 1536w, ../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gov_background_916-2048x1023.jpg 2048w, ../wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gov_background_916-600x300.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2162px) 100vw, 2162px" /></p><p><strong>Space Station MAASTRICHT:</strong> Named after the Maastricht Treaty that expedited the establishment of European Union, Space Station MAASTRICHT was a military station developed by the E.U.

High-speed shuttles depart from ground station ULYSSES and travel to orbit on Astro Ladder ILLIAD.</p><p>During the FATE War, this station was the command center for Mechanical Angel Legion ENVY (M.A.L.

The geosynchronous orbit leads to ground station SHUI JING GONG via Astro Ladder DING HAI.</p><p>Among the six major space stations, NAN TIAN MEN boasts the most space and staff. The chief investor is Gigacorp EKEKCONN.</p><p>During the FATE War, this station was the command center for Mechanical Angel Legion GLUTTONY (M.A.L. GLUTTONY).</p><p>After the war, NAN TIAN MEN belongs to G.U.N. on paper, but in reality Gigacorp EKEKCONN has regained control over this station.</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2095 size-full" src="../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SKETCH_NAN-TIAN-MEN_01.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1200" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SKETCH_NAN-TIAN-MEN_01.jpg 2000w, ../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SKETCH_NAN-TIAN-MEN_01-300x180.jpg 300w, ../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SKETCH_NAN-TIAN-MEN_01-1024x614.jpg 1024w, ../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SKETCH_NAN-TIAN-MEN_01-768x461.jpg 768w, ../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SKETCH_NAN-TIAN-MEN_01-1536x922.jpg 1536w, ../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SKETCH_NAN-TIAN-MEN_01-600x360.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p><p><strong>Space Station TAKAMAGAHARA:</strong> Named after the mythological abode of the Japanese gods, Space Station TAKAMAGAHARA was developed and constructed by Japan. The main investors for TAKAMAGAHARA are Gigacorps URANUS and AKSUM.</p><p>Originally, TAKAMAGAHARA designed to be used as a space station for a limited time, and then retrofitted into a deep space transport vessel. The intent was for TAKAMAGAHARA to serve as a multi-functional spacecraft to immigrate to Mars. Ever since Astro Ladder KUSANAGI began running, business and military operations have been in full bloom from ground station SUSANOO. Due to the economic prosperity of TAKAMAGAHARA, the planned colonization of Mars has been delayed indefinitely.</p><p>During the FATE War, this station was the command center for Mechanical Angel Legion WRATH (M.A.L. WRATH).</p><p>After the war, TAKAMAGAHARA was directly under G.U.N.’s control, and was one of the two space stations for the Security Council to convene a meeting. A recent unexplained explosion almost wiped out the core areas of TAKAMAGAHARA. Gravity and atmospheric pressure have been restored, but other facilities are still offline. Travel to TAKAMAGAHARA is not advised.</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2096 size-full" src="../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SKETCH_TAKAMAGAHARA_-01.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1200" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SKETCH_TAKAMAGAHARA_-01.jpg 2000w, ../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SKETCH_TAKAMAGAHARA_-01-300x180.jpg 300w, ../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SKETCH_TAKAMAGAHARA_-01-1024x614.jpg 1024w, ../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SKETCH_TAKAMAGAHARA_-01-768x461.jpg 768w, ../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SKETCH_TAKAMAGAHARA_-01-1536x922.jpg 1536w, ../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SKETCH_TAKAMAGAHARA_-01-600x360.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p><p><strong>Space Station RAMA:</strong> Constructed mainly by India, Space Station RAMA was named after Vishnu, one of the three main gods in Hinduism.
